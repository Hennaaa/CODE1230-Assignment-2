<h2>Sydney's Marital Status Statistics </h2>

<p>1. What is the data set? <br>
Registered Marital Status by Age by Sex <br><br>

2. Why is it collected? <br>
This data can help describe people's living arrangements, family formation and the social well-being of our society. The data also describes family dissolution for couples and children which is important for social program development and research. <br><br>

3. Which government department would use this data? <br>
The Department of Social Services, the Department of Education <br><br>

4. What private sectors would use it? <br>
Services for families, elderly care, businesses aimed at young people without children. <br><br>

5. How does the data set change the way you think about space? <br> 
The location of different groups of people depends largely on family status, subsequent financial situation and access to desired facilities.<br><br>

6. How does it change across Sydney? <br>
Observations from the data reveal: <br> 
- Single people are concentrated closer to the inner city and married people of the same age are further away <br>
- Younger married couples (25-34) are more concentrated in Sydney's South-West and West <br> 
- Middle aged married couples (45-54) are more evenly distributed with a higher proportion in the North Shore <br>
- Elderly singles are at the fringes of Sydney and more concentrated in Sydney's North <br><br>

7. Does it relate to the latte line? <br>
Yes the data does relate to the latte line as young married couples (possibly with children) occupy more affordable housing South of the latte line. Middle-aged married couples are more evenly distributed throughout Sydney with a higher proportion in the North Shore as they get older. <br><br>

8. How has the data set changed over time?  <br>
The dataset is unlikely to change in the near future due to a number of factors. The tendency for families to want a greater amount of space for their children means they will move to where larger housing is more affordable.<br><br>

9. How is it significant to people's lives? <br>
This data reveals the underlying distribution of different groups of people in Sydney. Younger, unmarried peole are located nearer the city and less affluent young couples are located further West. There are also a number of old aged care facilities on the outskirts of the city.<br><br>

10. Would it be good to keep it the same? <br>
There is no particular problem with this dataset except that it is not entirely evenly distributed. Schools, businesses and elderly care need to be appropriately distributed with equal access to facilities. <br><br>

11. If you were to change it, how?<br>
Create affordable housing nearer the city, promote multiple city hubs (eg. Parramatta) to provide jobs for people living further from the CBD, improve family related facilites such as schools below the latte line, change policies that allow the elderly to move into more appropriate housing (smaller houses, easily accessible facilities) <br><br>
